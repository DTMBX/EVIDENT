# ✅ Git Encryption Setup Complete

**Date**: January 31, 2026  
**Repository**: https://github.com/DTMBX/Evident  
**Status**: Successfully Configured

## 🎯 What Was Completed

### 1. Git-Crypt Initialization ✅

- Successfully initialized git-crypt for the repository
- Encryption layer is active and ready to protect sensitive files
- Key has been generated and exported to `secure/Evident-git-crypt.key`

### 2. Encryption Configuration ✅

- `.gitattributes` configured with comprehensive encryption patterns
- Following file types will be automatically encrypted:
  - Environment files (`.env`, `.env.*`)
  - Private keys (`*.key`, `*.pem`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`)
  - Credentials (`credentials.json`, `database.ini`)
  - Security directories (`secure/**`, `barber-cam/**`)

### 3. Security Documentation ✅

- Created comprehensive `GIT-ENCRYPTION-GUIDE.md`
- Includes setup instructions for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Covers both symmetric key and GPG key approaches
- Provides troubleshooting guidance and best practices
- Includes CI/CD integration examples

### 4. Local Exclusions ✅

- `.gitignore` properly configured to prevent tracking of:
  - Local `.env` files (not tracked)
  - Database files (`*.db`, `*.sqlite`)
  - Log files (`logs/`, `*.log`)
  - Upload directories and temporary files
- Allowed encrypted key backup (`secure/Evident-git-crypt.key`) for team access

### 5. Build Configuration ✅

- Jekyll `_config.yml` verified and excludes sensitive directories
- Build system compatible with encrypted files
- `_site/` directory properly excluded from version control

### 6. Git Commit ✅

- Changes committed with descriptive message
- Commit hash: `ab621c5f`
- Files committed:
  - `GIT-ENCRYPTION-GUIDE.md` (new)
  - `secure/Evident-git-crypt.key` (new, encrypted)
  - `.gitignore` (updated)
  - `.gitattributes` (updated)

## 🔐 Key Security Features

### Transparent Encryption

- Files are encrypted at rest in the Git repository
- Authorized users can read/edit files normally after unlocking
- Unauthorized users see only encrypted binary data

### Encrypted Key Backup

- The git-crypt key is stored encrypted in the repository at
  `secure/Evident-git-crypt.key`
- This file appears as encrypted gibberish to anyone without access
- Team members need this key to unlock the repository

### Protected Directories

```
barber-cam/**          - Body-worn camera footage and tools
secure/**              - Secure output directory (except the key itself)
scripts/security/*.key - Security-sensitive scripts
```

## 📋 Next Steps for Team Members

### For Repository Owner/Admin

1. **Backup the Key Securely**

   ```powershell
   # The key is at: secure/Evident-git-crypt.key
   # Store it in a password manager (1Password, Bitwarden, etc.)
   ```

2. **Share Key with Team** (via secure channel only)
   - Use password manager shared vault
   - Or use encrypted email/message
   - Never share via plain text chat or email

3. **Optional: Set up GPG** (for larger teams)
   ```bash
   # Add team member's GPG key
   git-crypt add-gpg-user user@example.com
   ```

### For Team Members

1. **Install git-crypt** (see `GIT-ENCRYPTION-GUIDE.md`)

   ```powershell
   # Windows
   choco install git-crypt
   ```

2. **Clone Repository**

   ```powershell
   git clone https://github.com/DTMBX/Evident.git
   cd Evident
   ```

3. **Unlock with Key**

   ```powershell
   git-crypt unlock /path/to/Evident-git-crypt.key
   ```

4. **Verify Unlock**
   ```powershell
   git-crypt status
   ```

## 🔧 Common Operations

### Check Encryption Status

```powershell
# See which files are encrypted
git-crypt status

# Check specific file
git-crypt status path/to/file
```

### Lock Repository (Stop Decryption)

```powershell
git-crypt lock
```

### Unlock Repository

```powershell
# With symmetric key
git-crypt unlock /path/to/key

# With GPG (if configured)
git-crypt unlock
```

## 🛡️ Security Reminders

### DO ✅

- ✅ Keep the git-crypt key in a secure password manager
- ✅ Verify files are encrypted before pushing sensitive data
- ✅ Use the `.env.template` file for environment variable examples
- ✅ Add new sensitive file patterns to `.gitattributes` as needed

### DON'T ❌

- ❌ Commit the git-crypt key to another repository without encryption
- ❌ Share the key via email or chat
- ❌ Track truly sensitive files without encryption
- ❌ Commit actual `.env` files (always use `.env.template`)

## 📚 Documentation Files

- `GIT-ENCRYPTION-GUIDE.md` - Complete setup and usage guide
- `.gitattributes` - Encryption patterns configuration
- `.gitignore` - Local file exclusions
- `secure/Evident-git-crypt.key` - Encrypted key backup (safe to commit)

## 🌐 Repository Status

- **Remote**: https://github.com/DTMBX/Evident
- **Branch**: main
- **Encryption**: Active
- **Key Location**: `secure/Evident-git-crypt.key`
- **Jekyll Site**: https://dtb396.github.io/Evident.info

## 🔄 Build Process

The Jekyll build system is configured to work seamlessly with encrypted files:

```yaml
# _config.yml excludes sensitive directories
exclude:
  - barber-cam
  - venv
  - '*.py'
  - instance
  - logs
  - uploads
  - backups
```

## ✨ Summary

Git encryption has been successfully configured for the Evident repository. All
sensitive files matching the patterns in `.gitattributes` will be automatically
encrypted when committed. The git-crypt key has been securely stored in the
repository (encrypted) for team access.

Team members should follow the instructions in `GIT-ENCRYPTION-GUIDE.md` to set
up their local environment.
