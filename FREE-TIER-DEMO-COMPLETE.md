## 🔧 Critical Fix Applied

**FIXED:** Missing `TierLevel` import
```python
# free_tier_demo_cases.py - Line 8 (ADDED)
from models_auth import TierLevel
```

**Before (❌):**
```python
# Line 210 - Would crash with NameError
if user.tier == TierLevel.FREE:  # TierLevel undefined
```

**After (✅):**
```python
from models_auth import TierLevel  # ← ADDED

# Line 210 - Now works
if user.tier == TierLevel.FREE:  # ✅ Works!
```
