## Tips & Tricks 🎯

### Trick 1: Use Past Tense for Historical Analysis
❌ Bad: "What cases protect privacy?"
✅ Good: "What cases have addressed digital privacy historically?"

### Trick 2: Ask for Contrasts
❌ Bad: "Tell me about constitutional privacy"
✅ Good: "How does the Fourth Amendment differ from the Fifth Amendment?"

### Trick 3: Request Specific Formats
❌ Bad: "Research this topic"
✅ Good: "Give me a bulleted summary of privacy law evolution"

### Trick 4: Build Context
❌ Bad: First message: "Will this win?"
✅ Good: 
1. First: "I have a case about..."
2. Then: "What precedent applies?"
3. Then: "Will this precedent help?"

### Trick 5: Leverage Tools
✅ Ask about tool capabilities
✅ Request tool usage explicitly
✅ Follow up on tool results
