## Pricing Psychology & Justification

### Why These Prices?

**Free Tier ($0)**
- Market leader positioning (vs. LexisNexis/Westlaw)
- Build 50K+ user base for future conversion
- Generate GitHub stars, word-of-mouth

**Lite ($29)**
- Break-even point: ~$2,000/month in support costs
- Targets solo practitioners (existing spending: $0-50/month on legal tech)
- Lower friction to conversion from free

**Standard ($59)**
- 2x Lite price (Premium customers spend 2x more)
- Targets small firms (existing spend: $100-300/month)
- Added forensic analysis justifies +$30

**Premium ($99)**
- 1.7x Standard price
- Targets growing firms (existing spend: $200-500/month)
- Team features, API access, advanced analytics justify price
- Most profitable tier (higher retention, less churn)

**Enterprise (Custom)**
- SaaS best practice: 10x+ premium tier
- Reflects true value: cost avoidance + ROI
- Example: 1 hour saved per lawyer per week = $12K/year savings
- 10 lawyers × 1 hour = $120K/year savings → $5K/month pricing justified

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk: Price Too High
**Mitigation**: Free tier builds audience, A/B test pricing, offer annual discounts

### Risk: Price Too Low  
**Mitigation**: Free to Lite conversion low → increase Lite pricing to $39 or $49

### Risk: Churn Higher Than Expected
**Mitigation**: Invest in onboarding, success team, feature improvements based on feedback

### Risk: Enterprise Sales Slow
**Mitigation**: Hire sales rep earlier, partner with legal tech resellers, attend conferences

### Risk: Free Tier Cannibalizes Pro
**Mitigation**: Limit features (10 PDFs), encourage upgrades with in-app messaging

---
