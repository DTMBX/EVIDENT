# --- Test framework ---
pytest==9.0.2                       # test runner
hypothesis==6.151.5                 # property-based testing
faker==40.4.0                       # synthetic test data generation
pytest-benchmark>=5.1.0             # performance benchmarking

# --- Linting & formatting ---
ruff==0.15.0                        # fast Python linter + formatter

# --- Batch processing progress ---
# NOTE: celery-progress==0.5 was evaluated but OMITTED.
# Reason: Django-only package (Django 3.2–5.1 framework classifiers).
# Incompatible with FastAPI architecture.
# Alternative: Build custom SSE/WebSocket progress endpoint with FastAPI.
# Celery task state is already trackable via celery.result.AsyncResult.
