## 📊 VERIFY IN DATABASE

### Check User Tier Upgrade

After test checkout, verify the user's tier was upgraded:

```bash
# Via Render Shell
python -c "
from app import app, db
from models_auth import User

with app.app_context():
    # Replace with the email you used in checkout
    user = User.query.filter_by(email='test@example.com').first()
    if user:
        print(f'User: {user.email}')
        print(f'Tier: {user.tier.name}')
        print(f'Subscription active: {user.is_subscription_active}')
    else:
        print('User not found')
"
```

Expected output:

```
User: test@example.com
Tier: PROFESSIONAL  (or PREMIUM)
Subscription active: True
```

## 🐛 TROUBLESHOOTING

### Pricing Page Returns 404

**Cause:** Payment routes not deployed  
**Solution:** Check Render deployment logs, ensure latest commit deployed

### Webhook Not Firing

**Cause:** Webhook URL incorrect or secret missing  
**Solution:**

1. Verify webhook endpoint: `https://Evident.info/payments/webhook`
2. Check Render env var: `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is set
3. Check webhook events are selected in Stripe dashboard

### Checkout Redirects But No Success Page

**Cause:** Session handling or database error  
**Solution:**

1. Check Render logs for errors
2. Verify database migration ran
3. Check user exists and tier updated

### Test Card Declined

**Cause:** Wrong test card number  
**Solution:** Use exact card number: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
